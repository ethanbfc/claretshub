                    period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your

                    is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal 
                    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

                    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
